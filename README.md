**WP React Redux** is an experimental WordPress theme built using a modern JavaScript workflow:
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for UI components
[React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) for routing
[Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) for managing state
[WP REST API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API) for getting data from the WordPress back end.
Webpack for asset bundling

** you can see an example working version on my website [here](http://amine.pw)
